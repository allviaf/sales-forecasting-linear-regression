# Project Description

In this project, I developed a simple time series forecasting model to predict the next 3 months of sales based on historical monthly sales data.
This model can help businesses plan inventory, marketing, and operations more efficiently.

# Technologies Used
1. Python

2. Pandas

3. Matplotlib

4. Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

# Dataset

Simulated monthly_sales.csv containing 24 months (Jan 2023 – Dec 2024) of sales data.

# Columns: 
Month, Sales

# Workflow
1. Loaded and visualized the historical sales trend.

2. Created a numeric time index for the months.

3. Built and trained a Linear Regression model.

4. Predicted sales for the next 3 months.

5. Visualized actual sales vs forecasted sales.

# Results

Month	    Predicted Sales
Month +1	₹18169
Month +2	₹18484
Month +3	₹18798


# Future Improvements
Use ARIMA or Prophet models for more accurate forecasting.

Incorporate seasonality adjustments.

Forecast further into the future (6 months, 12 months).
